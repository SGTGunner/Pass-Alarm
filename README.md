# Inferno Collection: Pass Alarm
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Fire-Alarm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Pass-Alarm)

__Public Beta Version 1.2__

The Pass Alarm resource adds the ability for players to enable a Pass Alarm on their person. While enabled, the Pass Alarm will sound an audible Alarm for all nearby players to hear, when a Firefighter stands still for too long. The resource is written in such a way that multiple players can have their Pass Alarms enabled at the same time, and when they can also go off at the same time as well.

Presently, the following can be customized:
- The radius within which an Alarm can be heard
- The pass alarm audio files
